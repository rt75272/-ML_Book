Once you pick a framework that allows modelling of your situation, you then see which elements are &quot;fixed&quot; and which are flexible. For example, the model may allow you to define your own network structure (or even learn it) with certain constraints. You have to decide whether this flexibility is sufficient for your purposes. Then within a particular network structure, you can learn parameters given a specific training dataset.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You rarely hard-code behavior in AI/ML solutions. It's all about modelling the underlying situation and accommodating different situations by tweaking elements of the model.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In your example, perhaps you might have the robot learn how to detect obstacles (by analyzing elements in the environment), or you might have it keep track of where the obstacles were and which way they were moving.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="51" LastActivityDate="2014-05-14T00:36:31.077" CommentCount="0" />
